    Requirements using the word **Shall**, must be satisfied to receive full points for this project. Those with the word **May**,
    indicate optional (not required) options in development. Numbers in brackets (i.e. [2,3]) indicate in what spiral(s) each requirement
    must be implemented. Up to 10 extra credit points may be given to each student in spiral 3. Coordinate with your instructor (the customer)
    to find out how valuable additional features may be.

    ### 0. DOCUMENTATION
    - **Shall** be submitted in Canvas for each submission [1,2,3]  
        - **Shall** be cumulative (i.e., also contain doc statements for all prior spirals).
    - **Shall** include your name `and section` at the top of each file [1,2,3]
    - **Shall** contain the list of any features for which extra credit is sought [3]
    - **Shall** list any shall requirements that are not fully functional and describe the deficiency [1,2,3]

    ### 1. THE GAME GRAPH WINDOW
    - **Shall** display 600 pixel high X 800 pixel wide screen.
    - **Shall** be able to scale the screen by 2/3 (two thirds) or 3/2 (three halves) these dimensions and maintain scale. `i.e. when we change the dimensions
    of the game window size, the images draw on screen the same, just smaller or bigger depending on the game window size.`
        - **Note**: missile/meteor sizes need not be adjusted.
    - **Shall** store and reference the `window` dimension values in appropriately named CONSTANTS. [1,2,3]
    - **Shall** have a window title consisting of three elements separated by hyphens [1,2,3]:
        - The course/game information: ‚ÄúCS110 (S25) Missile Defense‚Äù
        - The assignment identifier: e.g., ‚ÄúSpiral#3‚Äù
        - Your name: e.g., ‚ÄúC4C Tanya Smith‚Äù or ‚ÄúC4C Fred Jones‚Äù
    
    Example: `‚ÄúCS110 (S24) Battle Boats ‚Äì Spiral#3 ‚Äì C4C Tanya Smith‚Äù`

    ### 2. GAME PLAY
    - **Shall** launch missile at coordinates clicked [2,3]
    - **Shall** have missiles originate from bottom center of screen [2,3]
    - **Shall** have missile explode when missile reaches destination [2,3]
    - **Shall** have explosion expand and shrink [2,3]
    - **Shall** destroy meteors caught in explosion [2,3]
    - **Shall** create secondary explosion originating from destroyed meteor [2,3]
    - **Shall** visually indicate location of cities [1,3]
    - **Shall** visually indicate whether each city is undamaged or destroyed [3]
    - **Shall** display ‚Äògame over‚Äô status when game is complete [3]
    - **Shall** show meteors with line from meteor origin [1,3]
    - **Shall** randomly generate meteors to appear at the top of the screen at random times [3]
    - **Shall** have meteors travel on a path to a random location at the bottom of the screen [3]
    - **Shall** have missiles travel at a constant speed (not constant in just y direction) [2,3]
    - **Shall** have meteors travel at a constant speed (not constant in just y direction) [3]
    - **Shall** add additional feature or features [3]
    - **Shall** indicate when the game is over (all 4 cities destroyed) [3]
